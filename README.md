#Unit 1 homework assignment: Fintech case study: Afterpay
## Overview and origin of Afterpay
___
Afterpay is an ASX listed company which is part of the popular and ever growing financial technology (Fintech) payments actor, specifically, the buy now pay later (BNPL) sector. Afterpay was founded by Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen in 2015 in Sydney, Australia, and now has millions of customers not only in Australia, but also in the US, Canada, UK and New Zealand.

Talking to News.com.au, Nick Molnar explains how he, and then neighbour and co-founder  Anthony Eisen came up with the idea for Afterpay. He goes on to explain how they saw a shift in spending amongst millennials after the 2008 financial crisis, saying â€œThere was just a huge swing among Millennials toward spending money on debit cards, not credit cards". He goes on to explain how millenials, now their target audience, are tech savvy and conscious about not falling into debt. This is where they saw a gap in the payments sector and took advantage with a simple, yet extremely popular "layby" themed payments concept.     

Afterpay raised 25 million (25 million shares at $1) at their initial IPO to take the company public. Bell Potter securities limited and Wilson HTM acted as joint lead managers and underwriters of the IPO.Afterpay generates its revenue from transaction fees from the retail merchant, along with late fees. This is unique in the sense that the retail merchant is charged the fee and not the customer.

## Landscape
___
Although Afterpay is in the payments domain of the finance sector, specifically the BNPL sector, they are not listed in the finance industry under their listing of the ASX, they are technically in the technology software and services industry. This is a huge innovation in this landscape, as companies like Afterpay, are using their technology toto move into new spaces in the finance world, which has given rise to the BNPL sector. Where before you would have to apply for a credit card and a loan from a financial institution, that are heavily regulated with credit risk protocols, which generally come from existing large institutions that take time and incur fees and interest rates. Now, you can apply online and within minutes technology firms assess the risk and finance the payment, all while, for the most part, unregulated. There are talks about major shake ups with in the industry in terms of regulation coming in to limit the amount of missed payments, defaults, and people over spending. While smaller companies and start ups like after have been able to take advantage of this space, larger institutions, like commonwealth bank and pay pal are starting to enter the sector adding more competition. 

With the rise of BNPL, credit card use has seen a decrease. See image below. for example, from 2018 to 2019, the number of credit card accounts dropped nearly 5%, with 69% of millennials using their credit card less as a result of Afterpay.

Some of the competitors in the Australian BNPL sector are Zip Pay and Zip Money, Humm & Bundll, Openpay, CommBank BNPL and Klarna, PayPal Pay in 4, Laybuy, Latitude Pay


## Results
___
Although some businesses took a financial hit and in some cases closure during the recent pandemic and Covid-19 situation, afterpay saw a huge surge in retail merchants and customers with the increase of online shopping. The 3 major metrics used in the BNPL sector are transaction volume, retail partners, and customers. Afterpay, as of 202 have 48000 retail merchants, 3 million active customers, and generating 7.6 billion dollars in transaction volume. This compared with Zip Co 24500 retail merchants, 2.1 million active customers and 2.1 billion in transaction value. 

In 2020, Afterpay released an economic statement outlining some of the economic benefits and impact on businesses it has had. Some of the key metrics included in this report are:
Generating 3.1 billion in total net benefits to the Australian economy in 2020
As stated above, 48,000 Australian retail partners generating 7.6 billion in sales to its 3 million active Australian users
Saving Australians $110 million in consumer fees and interest compared to credit cards in 2020
## Recommendations
___
Afterpay allows you to pay in 4 installments over 6 weeks. So you pay your first instalment at the time of purchase, and the remainder every two weeks. After pay could keep this model, as well as adding options to pay over different time frequencies. This is something that one of afterpays competitors, Zip pay offer, allowing customers to spread the cost of the purchases over weekly, fortnightly or monthly payments. Afterpay would be able to use the same technology for risk analysis, but add in varying risk profiles to counteract any potential increase in risk by spreading the repayments over different frequencies.  

This could potentially increase their customer base by being more attractive to more customers that may not be comfortable with the fortnightly repayment structure already in place.
